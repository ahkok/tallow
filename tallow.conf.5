.SH "NAME"
\fBtallow\fR
.
.SH "tallow\.conf"
The tallow configuration file
.
.SH "NAME"
tallow\.conf \- Tallow daemon configuration file
.
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
\fB/etc/tallow\.conf\fR
.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This file is read on startup by the tallow(1) daemon, and can be used to provide options to the tallow daemon\. If not present, tallow will operate with built\-in defaults\.
.
.SH "OPTIONS"
\fBipt_path\fR=\fB<string>\fR Specifies the location of the ipset(1), iptables(1) or ip6tables(1) program\. By default, tallow will look in "/usr/sbin" for them\.
.
.P
\fBexpires\fR=\fB<int>\fR The number of seconds that IP addresses are blocked for\. Note that due to the implementation, IP addresses may be blocked for much longer than this period\. If IP addresses are seen, but not blocked within this period, they are also removed from the watch list\. Defaults to 3600s\.
.
.P
\fBwhitelist\fR=\fB<ip address|pattern>\fR Specify an IP address or \fBpattern\fR that should never be blocked\. Multiple IP addresses can be included by repeating the \fBwhitelist\fR option several times\. By default, 127\.0\.0\.1, 192\.168\., and 10\. are whitelisted\. If you create a manual whitelist, you must include these entries if you want to continue them to be whitelisted as well, otherwise they will be omitted from the whitelist\.
.
.P
If the last character of the listed ip adress is a \fB\.\fR or a \fB:\fR, then the matching is only performed on the leftmost characters of an IP address against the whitelist entry\. For instance, if you whitelist \fB10\.\fR then all IP addresses in the \fB10/8\fR subnet mask will match this whitelist entry and never be blocked\.
.
.P
\fBipv6\fR=\fB<0|1>\fR Enable of disable ipv6 (ip6tables) support\. Ipv6 is disabled automatically on systems that do not appear to have ipv6 support and enabled when ipv6 is present\. Use this option to explicitly disable ipv6 support if your system does not have ipv6 or is missing ip6tables\. Even with ipv6 disabled, tallow will track and log ipv6 addresses\.
.
.P
\fBnocreate\fR=\fB<0|1>\fR Disable the creation of iptables rules and ipset sets\. By default, tallow will create new iptables(1) and ip6tables(1) rules when needed automatically\. If set to \fB1\fR, \fBtallow(1)\fR will not create any new iptables rules or ipset sets to work\. You should create them manually before tallow starts up and remove them afterwards\. To create them manually, you can use the following commands:
.
.IP "" 4
.
.nf

  iptables \-t filter \-I INPUT \-m set \-\-match\-set tallow src \-j DROP
  ipset create tallow hash:ip family inet timeout 3600

  ip6tables \-t filter \-I INPUT \-m set \-\-match\-set tallow6 src \-j DROP
  ipset create tallow6 hash:ip family inet6 timeout 3600
